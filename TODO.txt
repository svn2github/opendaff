- why is freqs a parameter of the data function? should be a global parameter

- validate metadata structure in daff_write.m

- check all pointers (offsets) from daff-file if they point outside the file

- fix display bug in daffviewer (see piston_directivity.daff)

- maybe rename getAlphaPoints to getNumAlphaPoints in DAFFProperties

- find an efficient way to convert arrays: RI -> MP
	maybe use SIMD? No.

- implement the new content interface classes ***
	IR, PS, MS, MPS, DFT:
	libdaff ***
	dafftool *** 
	daff_write.m *** 
	daffmex *** 
	
- DAFFHeader.h Z212:
	// Next: Support frequency values [in Hertz] (float)
	??

- DAFFReaderImpl.cpp Z490:
	// Logical constness here!
	// TODO: Bad cast
	??
	
- Add some meaningfull test/exmaple for IR

- dafftool: DUMP: dump out the main metadata if present
	RESOLVED
	
- libdaff: reading MS with more than one channel returns wrong data
	RESOLVED: wrong index in getMagnitudes (and getPhases)
	
- daff_write.m Z380:
	write fallback for datafunc without metadata
	RESOLVED: 3. parameter 'metadata' has to be specified!
	
- dafftool: QUERY: angle in filename and in the exported file itself should be the angle specified as parameter, not the real angle of the nearest neighbor.
	RESOLVED
	
- fix bug in daff_write.m: using multiple channels doesn't work
	when trying to write multiple channels into a daff-file, you get an error. Try tests/multichannel_test.m for example.

	error message is:

	??? Insufficient outputs from right hand side to satisfy comma
	separated
	list expansion on left hand side.  Missing [] are the most likely
	cause.

	Error in ==> daff_write at 786
					x{a,b}.dataOffset = zeros(1, args.channels);

	Error in ==> another_test at 9
	daff_write('filename', 'ms.daff',...
	RESOLVED: works now, but need improvement: Initialization of x{a,b}.dataOffset is missing.
