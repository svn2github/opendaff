====================
 Compiling OpenDAFF
====================

OpenDAFF uses CMake 

For Windows and Mac download CMake from http://www.cmake.org
Under Linux it is typically found in your package management system

The simplest way to build OpenDAFF with CMake is as follows:

- Checkout the source code
  > svn checkout http://opendaff.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/opendaff/trunk

- Run CMake to generate build files for your platform
  > cmake .
  
- If you created Unix makefiles you build the library by
  > make
  > make install
  
- If you created project files for your IDE (e.g. CodeBlocks or VisualStudio),
  open them in your IDE and build the library there
  

Microsoft Visual C++ / Visual Studio compilers
----------------------------------------------

You should use CMake to create Visual Studio project files.
However, we still host native project files for Visual Studio 2010.
You find them in the "project" directory
