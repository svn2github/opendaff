% Try to open your file (result is a handle)
% (any failure will result in a Matlab error and halt the execution)

% Now you can get your hands on the properties (returned as a struct)
% Note: All important information on the file is contained in the properties

% If you like, you can get the metadata as well, like this...
% The result is returned also as a struct

% In order to interpret the data, we need to know
% about the frequencies at which values are defined...
% These are also defined within the properties

% Now we fetch the frontal impulse response record,
% in object coordinates (P0°,T0°)

% Lets plot the magnitude spectrum (decibel)
